# Drug Data Discovery using PubChem

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed for discovering and analyzing drug data using the PubChem database. The notebook explores drug-related datasets, processes information, and provides insights through computational analysis.

## Features
- **Integration with PubChem API**: Retrieve drug-related data programmatically.
- **Data Processing**: Clean, filter, and organize datasets for meaningful insights.
- **Visualization**: Generate plots and charts to understand the data better.
- **Analysis**: Conduct specific analyses on drug properties and interactions.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, requests, and other dependencies specified in the notebook


## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drug-data-discovery
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd drug-data-discovery
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Drug Data Discovery_pubchem.ipynb
    ```
4. Run the notebook cells step by step to execute the analysis.

## File Structure
- **`Drug Data Discovery_pubchem.ipynb`**: The main notebook containing the analysis.
- **`Data/`**: (Optional) Directory to store input and output datasets.

## Outputs
The notebook generates:
- Dataframes of processed drug data.
- Visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, etc.).
- Summary tables and insights derived from the analysis.


## Acknowledgments
- [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) for providing the API and database.
